# Usage
When the page is loaded the page presents my name, and links to sections showing my personal profile, my work, and how I can be contacted.

When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my projects.

When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application

When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
